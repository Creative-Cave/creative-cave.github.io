			</div>

			<p>
				The Creative Cave came to be at the beginning of December 2021,
				branching off another server which was due to close.
			</p>
			<p>
				The server, then called Writer's Cave, was made partly to preserve the
				community of the server that preceded it, and partly to open a space
				where writers could come together to share their work.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since then, Writer's Cave grew into the Creative Cave, broadening
				the scope of the community to include all kinds of creators at all
				kinds of skill levels and bringing a wide range of artistic mediums
				together.
